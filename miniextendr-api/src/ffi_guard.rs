//! Unified FFI guard for catching panics at Rust-R boundaries.
//!
//! Four modules independently catch panics at FFI boundaries: `worker.rs`,
//! `altrep_bridge.rs`, `unwind_protect.rs`, and `connection.rs`. This module
//! extracts the common pattern into a single `guarded_ffi_call` function.
//!
//! Most user code never calls anything here. The proc-macro layer
//! (`#[miniextendr]`) inserts the right guard at every Rust → R boundary it
//! generates. Reach for these helpers when you're writing a callback or
//! trampoline that the macros don't already cover (custom connections,
//! manual ALTREP, raw FFI shims).
//!
//! ## Guard Modes
//!
//! - [`GuardMode::CatchUnwind`]: Wraps the closure in `catch_unwind`. On panic,
//!   fires telemetry and raises an R error via `Rf_error` (diverges).
//!   Used by worker and connection trampolines.
//!
//! - [`GuardMode::RUnwind`]: Uses `R_UnwindProtect` to catch both Rust panics
//!   and R longjmps. Used by ALTREP callbacks that call R APIs. Routes
//!   through `crate::unwind_protect::with_r_unwind_protect_sourced`
//!   (crate-private).
//!
//! The ALTREP-specific `Unsafe` mode (no protection at all) stays in
//! `altrep_bridge.rs` since it has no general applicability.
//!
//! ## Tradeoffs vs raising R errors directly
//!
//! Don't reach for `Rf_error` / `Rf_errorcall` to fail out of a callback —
//! the longjmp skips Rust destructors and the lint **MXL300** rejects it.
//! Panic instead; whichever guard mode you pick converts the panic into the
//! tagged-condition transport ([`crate::error_value`]) or, on the ALTREP
//! `RUnwind` path, raises a structured `rust_*` condition via the
//! crate-private `raise_rust_condition_via_stop` helper.
//!
//! ## Cross references
//!
//! - [`crate::worker::with_r_thread`] — main-thread routing entry point.
//! - [`crate::unwind_protect::with_r_unwind_protect`] — the user-facing R
//!   error catcher; consumed by `RUnwind` mode.
