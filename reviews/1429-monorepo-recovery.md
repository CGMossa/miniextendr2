# Interrupted monorepo build recovery (#1429)

A monorepo path-dependency build can freeze src/rust/Cargo.toml to vendor
paths. Removing only inst/vendor.tar.xz leaves those paths behind, so the
next metadata/configure operation fails if vendor is absent. The scaffolder
also inferred package names from arbitrary name lines, assumed every core
crate lived in a child directory, and omitted crate_name_rs. Starting R from
the suggested package subdirectory could select an older helper installation.

The freeze writer also emitted an empty [patch] parent heading. Make that
parent implicit while retaining [patch.crates-io], with a serialized-output
regression assertion.

An initial edit embedded quote-producing code inside a quoted CLI message and
failed R parsing. Construct the displayed build call separately, then interpolate
that value into the message.

The existing-project scaffold now asks Cargo for its workspace packages and
selects a library member (the root library by default; an explicit `crate_name`
resolves ambiguous virtual workspaces). It derives the dependency path from the
selected manifest, names the binding package separately from its library, and
uses a `core_library` dependency alias so a package named `core` does not shadow
Rust's standard library. Existing libraries have arbitrary APIs, so their
scaffold does not emit a call to a presumed `hello()` function. The newly created
library template still provides and demonstrates that function.

The first regression run passed Cargo metadata assertions for both layouts but
failed two message assertions: CLI wrapped “from this workspace root” across
lines. The assertion now normalizes display whitespace before checking the
workspace-root build instructions.

The end-to-end root-package build then reached a second assumption in
`cargo-revendor`: workspace-root discovery walked parents looking for the
literal `[workspace]` table and aborted on a standalone library. It now uses
`cargo locate-project --workspace`, which recognizes Cargo's implicit
single-package workspaces as well as explicit workspace membership.

The complete Rust suite also caught the CLI's embedded-template consumer: it
did not supply the newly required core path. The CLI now supplies the same
workspace-derived dependency path, distinct binding package name and commented
existing-API example as the R scaffolder. Its `init use --crate-name` selects
an explicit virtual-workspace member. Both template consumers retain simple
string substitution; a comment-prefix variable controls whether the known
new-library `hello()` example is enabled.

The new Cargo workspace-root regression caught macOS's `/var` versus
`/private/var` spelling: `cargo locate-project` preserves the input spelling.
The helper canonicalizes the returned directory, retaining its previous path
identity contract.

With standalone packaging working, the real tarball install exposed a second
vendoring bug: renamed path dependencies were looked up by the dependency key
rather than their `package` field, leaving `core_library` pointed at the
workspace root inside the tarball. Freeze, vendored-path repair and package
version insertion now resolve the actual package name while preserving the
alias and dependency options. Regression coverage exercises inline and table
forms, including build dependencies.

The successful local-framework builds revealed one last source-tree side
effect: `cargo package` appended `[[patch.unused]] core` to the framework
workspace's existing `Cargo.lock` while using transient patches. Packaging now
snapshots/restores that existing lock alongside its manifests; a real
standalone-package regression checks that the lock's bytes remain unchanged.

An unrelated parallel telemetry test emitted a swallowed assertion panic during
validation. It is tracked separately in #1492. The R package check's existing
AGENTS.md NOTE is tracked by #1409 and already fixed in open PR #1487.
